# BudgetLy
Is a remaster of a project created for a hackathon, where I failed to show its true potential.
The original was good and worked just fine, but with not so much time to refine it, it had so many UI bugs and the logic wasn't complety.

Being that I wanted to dive into Jetpack compose and Clean Architecture I decided to make the app again in a way where I will feel proud of the final product

Everything is benig build with Jetpack Compose.
Tecnologies used to the moment:
  - Room Database;
  - Retrofit2;
  - Dependecy injection (Dagger 2)
  - Kotlin Coroutine, LiveData and Flow
